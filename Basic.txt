TC1305 Step 5:
7.4.1
7.4.7
7.4.1.1
Wait, what?
THis may need to be corrected. If an auditor is on-site, and does these things in order, and it so happens
that 7.4.1 ends up referring to a set of devices that are inefficient to test and should be done in one go
then when the auditor realizes that they just ignored a bunch of tests that require a review from those
same devices/employees, the contractor may get ticked.
This is a minor problem, but it shouldn't exist. Looks like whoever was organizing this thing focused on
the first three numbers in non-decimal integers and so the 1.1 was treated as 11 > 7. 

TC 1383 Step 10:
I forgot to select a trade before completing the form for this test, went to the trade section to select
a trade, and when I was done the warning sign was still there. Now I know that recalculating/refreshing is
usually the normal way to go, but a large warning sign that persists after doing what it says may be a
little stressful to non-technologically adept users.
